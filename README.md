# 8chips-assembly-simulator

roughly following along with / inspired by:
* https://www.nand2tetris.org
* [Digital Computer Electronics](https://books.google.com/books/about/Digital_Computer_Electronics.html?id=1QaMPwAACAAJ&source=kp_book_description
)


Contains:
* An assembler for a byte code language
* A simulator for a processor that runs the byte code language - with a very simple instruction set.
* A UI for the simulator using imgui.net
* A vm translator/implementation - which transpiles vm intermediate language into assembly.
* some tests.

A register level simulator and verilog implementation of this cpu exits here:
